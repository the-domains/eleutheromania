  Though Holi is celebrated all across India, you're likely to find more festive
  celebrations in North India. Celebrations in southern India are a bit more
  religious and focus on temple rituals. Each city celebrates a little
  differently, so the best place to go really depends on the type of experience
  you'd like to have.
