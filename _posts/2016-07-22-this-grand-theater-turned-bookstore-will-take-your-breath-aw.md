  Book lovers, consider your next vacation planned. Buenos Aires' El Ateneo
  Grand Splendid bookstore is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Built in
  1919, the space ― originally a theater and later a movie theater ― was turned
  into a bookstore in 2000 when it was, according to Atlas Obscura, at risk for
  demolition.
